LOM - The Live Object Model
Object Model Overview
API Objects
Objects which comprise the Live API described by their structure, properties and functions. The Live
Object Model lists a number of Live object classes with their properties and functions, as well as
their parent-child relations through which a hierarchy is formed. Please refer to the Live API
overview chapterfor definitions of the basic Live API terms and a list of the Max objects used to
access it.
This document refers to Ableton Live version 12.3b9

Returns: view names  [list of symbols].
This is a constant list of view names to be used as an argument when calling other functions:
Browser Arranger Session Detail Detail/Clip Detail/DeviceChain .
focus_view
Parameter: view_name
Shows named view and focuses on it. You can also pass an empty view_name “ ", which refers to the
Arrangement or Session View (whichever is visible in the main window).
hide_view
Parameter: view_name
Hides the named view. You can also pass an empty view_name “ ", which refers to the Arrangement
or Session View (whichever is visible in the main window).
is_view_visible
Parameter: view_name
Returns: [bool] Whether the specified view is currently visible.
scroll_view

=== PAGE 10 ===
Live Object Model / Application.View
10
Parameters: direction view_name modifier_pressed
direction  [int] is 0 = up, 1 = down, 2 = left, 3 = right
modifier_pressed  [bool] If view_name is "Arranger" and modifier_pressed is 1 and direction is
left or right, then the size of the selected time region is modified, otherwise the position of the
playback cursor is moved.
Not all views are scrollable, and not in all directions. Currently, only the Arranger , Browser ,
Session , and Detail/DeviceChain  views can be scrolled.
You can also pass an empty view_name " " , which refers to the Arrangement or Session View
(whichever view is visible).
show_view
Parameter: view_name
toggle_browse
Displays the device chain and the browser and activates Hot-Swap Mode for the selected device.
Calling this function again deactivates Hot-Swap Mode.
zoom_view
Parameter: direction view_name modifier_pressed
direction  [int] - 0 = up, 1 = down, 2 = left, 3 = right
modifier_pressed  [bool] If view_name  is 'Arrangement', modifier_pressed  is 1, and
direction  is left or right, then the size of the selected time region is modified, otherwise the
position of the playback cursor is moved. If view_name  is Arrangement and modifier_pressed  is
1 and direction  is up or down, then only the height of the highlighted track is changed,
otherwise the height of all tracks is changed.
Only the Arrangement and Session Views can be zoomed. For Session View, the behaviour of
zoom_view is identical to scroll_view. You can also pass an empty view_name “ ", which refers to the
Arrangement or Session View (whichever is visible in the main window).

Functions

=== PAGE 17 ===

delete_device
Parameter: index  [int]
Delete the device at the given index.
insert_device
Parameters: device_name  [symbol] target_index  [int] (optional)
Attempts to insert the device specified by device_name  at the given index in the chain. If no index
is provided, attempts to insert the device at the end. Throws an error if insertion is not possible.
device_name  is the name as it appears in the UI of Live.
Not all indices are valid. As can be expected, indices outside of the range defined by the current
length of the device chain are invalid, but there are other limitations: for example, a MIDI effect
can't be inserted after an instrument. The rule of thumb is that if an index would be invalid when
inserting using the mouse, it's invalid here.
At the moment, only native Live devices can be inserted. Max for Live devices and plug-in are not
supported.
Available since Live 12.3.

notes bang
Observer sends bang when the list of notes changes.
Available for MIDI clips only.
warp_markers dict/bang
The Clip's Warp Markers as a dict. Observing this property bangs when the warp_markers change.
The last Warp Marker in the dict is not visible in the Live interface. This hidden marker is used to
calculate the BPM of the last segment.
Available for audio clips only.
Getting is available since Live 11.0.
pitch_coarse int
Pitch shift in semitones ("Transpose"), -48 ... 48.
Available for audio clips only.
pitch_fine float
Extra pitch shift in cents ("Detune"), -50 ... 49.
Available for audio clips only.
playing_position float
Current playing position of the clip.
For MIDI and warped audio clips, the value is given in beats of absolute clip time. The clip's beat
time of 0 is where 1 is shown in the bar/beat/16th time scale at the top of the clip view.

The start marker of the clip in beats, independent of the loop state. Cannot be set behind the end
marker.
start_time float
The start time of the clip, relative to the global song time. The value is in beats.
For Arrangement View clips, this is the offset within the arrangement. For Session View clips, this is
the time the clip was started. Note that what is reported is the start_time of the currently playing
clip on the track, regardless of which clip.
When a Session View clip's playback position was offset by clicking in its time ruler in the Clip
Detail View or moving its start marker, its start_time may be negative. This allows using the
start_time as an offset when calculating the clip's current playback position based on the global
song time.
velocity_amount float
How much the velocity of the note that triggers the clip affects its volume, 0 = no effect, 1 = full
effect.
Available since Live 11.0.
warp_mode int
The Warp Mode of the clip as an integer index. Available Warp Modes are:
0 = Beats Mode
1 = Tones Mode
2 = Texture Mode
3 = Re-Pitch Mode
4 = Complex Mode
5 = REX Mode
6 = Complex Pro Mode

Technical note: Internally, Live will defer the setting of this property. This has the consequence that
if you are sequencing API calls from a single event, the actual order of operations may differ from
what you'd intuitively expect. Most of the time this should be transparent to you, but if you run into
issues, please report them.

Functions
add_new_notes
Parameter:
dictionary
Key: "notes"  [list of note specification dictionaries]
Note specification dictionaries have the following keys:
pitch  : [int] the MIDI note number, 0...127, 60 is C3.
start_time  : [float] the note start time in beats of absolute clip time.
duration  : [float] the note length in beats.
velocity (optional)  : [float] the note velocity, 0 ... 127 (100 by default).
mute (optional)  : [bool] 1 = the note is deactivated (0 by default).
probability (optional)  : [float] the chance that the note will be played:
1.0 = the note is always played
0.0 = the note is never played
(1.0 by default).
velocity_deviation (optional)  : [float] the range of velocity values at which the note can be

=== PAGE 34 ===
Live Object Model / Clip
34
played:
0.0 = no deviation; the note will always play at the velocity specified by the velocity property
-127.0 to 127.0 = the note will be assigned a velocity value between velocity and velocity +
velocity_deviation, inclusive; if the resulting range exceeds the limits of MIDI velocity (0 to 127),
then it will be clamped within those limits
(0.0 by default).
release_velocity (optional)  : [float] the note release velocity (64 by default).
Returns a list of note IDs of the added notes.
For MIDI clips only.
Available since Live 11.0.
add_warp_marker
Only available for warped Audio Clips. Adds the specified warp marker, if possible.
The warp marker is specified as a dict which can have a beat_time  and a sample_time  key, both
associated with float values.
The sample_time  key may be omitted; in this case, Live will calculate the appropriate sample time
to create a warp marker at the specified beat time without changing the Clip's playback timing,
similar to what would happen if you were to double-click in the upper half of the Sample Display in
Clip View.
If sample_time  is specified, certain limitations must be taken into account: \
The sample time must lie within the range [0, s], where s is the sample's length. The
sample_length  Clip property helps with this.
The sample time must lie between the left and right adjacents markers' respective sample
times (this is a logical constraint).
Within these constraints, there are limitations on the resulting segments' BPM. The allowed
BPM range is [5, 999].
apply_note_modifications

will be inserted after the last selected note. This behavior can be observed when duplicating notes
in the Live GUI.
If the transposition_amount is specified, the duplicated notes will be transposed by the number of
semitones.
Available for MIDI clips only.
Available since Live 11.1.2

A ControlSurface can be reached either directly by the root path control_surfaces N  or by
getting a list of active control surface IDs, via calling get control_surfaces on an Application object.
The latter list is in the same order in which control surfaces appear in Live's Link/MIDI Preferences.
Note the same order is not guaranteed when getting a control surface via the
control_surfaces N  path.
A control surface can be thought of as a software layer between the Live API and, in this case, Max
for Live. Individiual controls on the surface are represented by objects that can be grabbed and
released via Max for Live, to obtain and give back exclusive control (see grab_control and
release_control). In this way, parts of the hardware can be controlled via Max for Live while other
parts can retain their default functionality.
Additionally, Live offers a special MaxForLive  control surface that has a register_midi_control
function. Using this, Max for Live developers can set up entirely custom control surfaces by adding
and grabbing arbitrary controls.

Functions
get_control

=== PAGE 54 ===
Live Object Model / ControlSurface
54
Parameter: name
Returns the control with the given name.
get_control_names
Returns the list of all control names.
grab_control
Parameter: control
Take ownership of the control. This releases all standard functionality of the control, so that it can
be used exclusively via Max for Live.
grab_midi
Forward MIDI messages received by the control surface script from the control surface to Max for
Live.
Note: the control surface script will only receive those channel messages from Live's engine that it
explicitly requests. For example, a script might use a specific note message to toggle transport in
Live; it will thus request that this note message be forwarded to it from Live.
Messages used for purely real-time purposes, on the other hand, will often bypass the script and
instead just be sent to Live's tracks; this is true, for example, of Push's pads in Note (but not
Session) mode. Accordingly, the API object will not output these real-time pad messages; to work
with track messages, use objects such as midiin .
register_midi_control
Parameters:
name  [symbol]
status  [int]
number  [int]
(MaxForLive control surface only) Register a MIDI control defined by status and number. Supported

=== PAGE 55 ===
Live Object Model / ControlSurface
55
status codes are 144 (note on), 176 (continuous control) and 224 (pitchbend).
Returns the LOM ID associated with the control.
Once a control is registered and grabbed via grab_control, Live will forward associated MIDI
messages that it receives to Max for Live. Max for Live can send values to the control (e.g. to light
an LED) by calling send_value on the control object.
release_control
Parameter: control
Re-establishes the standard functionality for the control.
release_midi
Stop forwarding MIDI messages received from the control surface to Max for Live.
send_midi
Parameter: midi_message  [list of int]
Send midi_message to the control surface.
send_receive_sysex
Parameters:
sysex_message  [list of int]
timeout  [symbol, int]
Send sysex_message to the control surface and await a response.
If the message is followed by the word timeout and a float, this sets the response timeout
accordingly. The default timeout value is 0.2.
If the response times out and MIDI has not been grabbed via grab_midi, it's not forwarded to Max
for Live. If MIDI has been grabbed via Max for Live, received messages are always forwarded, but
the timeout is still reported.

Given a valid LOM ID of an empty clip slot on a non-frozen audio track, will export Looper's content
to a clip in that slot. This is similar to using the Drag Me! control on the Looper device, and the
same restrictions apply: the audio engine must be turned on, the Looper must actually hold audio
content, the content must have a fixed length (i.e. Looper must not be recording), etc.

This button is used to indicate that the current state of the playback differs from what is stored in
the Arrangement.
Setting this property to 0 will make Live go back to playing the track's arrangement content. For
group tracks, this means that all of the tracks that belong to the group and any subgroups will go
back to playing the arrangement.

Functions

=== PAGE 161 ===
Live Object Model / Track
161
create_audio_clip
Parameters:
file_path  [symbol]
position  [float]
Given an absolute path to a valid audio file in a supported format, creates an audio clip that
references the file at the specified position in the arrangement view. Prints an error if the track is
not an audio track, if the track is frozen, or if the track is being recorded into. The position must be
within the range [0., 1576800].
See the ClipSlot.create_audio_clip  function if you need to create audio clips in session view
instead.
create_midi_clip
Parameters:
start_time  [float]
length  [float]
Creates an empty MIDI clip and inserts it into the arrangement at the specified time. Throws an
error when called on a non-MIDI track or a frozen track, when the specified time is outside the [0.,
1576800.] range, or when the track is currently being recorded into.
See the ClipSlot.create_clip  function if you need to create audio clips in session view instead.
create_take_lane
Creates a take lane for this track.
delete_clip
Parameter: clip
Delete the given clip.

=== PAGE 162 ===
Live Object Model / Track
162
delete_device
Parameter: index
Delete the device at the given index.
duplicate_clip_slot
Parameter: index
Works like 'Duplicate' in a clip's context menu.
duplicate_clip_to_arrangement
Parameters: clip``destination_time  [float]
Duplicate the given clip to the Arrangement, placing it at the given destination_time in beats.
insert_device
Parameters: device_name  [symbol] target_index  [int] (optional)
Attempts to insert the device specified by device_name  at the given index in the track's device
chain. If no index is provided, attempts to insert the device at the end of the chain. Throws an error
if insertion is not possible.
device_name  is the name as it appears in the UI of Live.
Not all indices are valid. As can be expected, indices outside of the range defined by the current
length of the device chain are invalid, but there are other limitations: for example, a MIDI effect
can't be inserted after an instrument. The rule of thumb is that if an index would be invalid when
inserting using the mouse, it's invalid here.
At the moment, only native Live devices can be inserted. Max for Live devices and plug-in are not
supported.
Available since Live 12.3.
