While AbletonMCP is powerful, understanding its limitations will help you work more effectively and
avoid frustration. 
These limitations exist because certain Ableton Live features require direct
interaction with the software's user interface or file system.

Limitations

Cannot Load sample and External vst/vst3  Plugins
It still cant load audio samples into drum racks
It cant read devices status and adjust parameters
It cant write automations
Third-party VST and AU plugins cannot be loaded by Abletonmcp. Only native Ableton devices can
be created.
It cant read the sample library of the user, not the ableton library, the custom paths off the user

To do:

create new tools for the mcp-server to:

navigate in the browser, 
read devices status and parameters, 
adjust devices parameters,
access the paths from the audio samples,
load audio sample
create automations,
load vst
