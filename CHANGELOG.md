# Changelog

All notable changes to AbletonMCP Beta will be documented in this file.

---

## v1.9.1

### New: Batch Parameter Setting (1 tool)
- `set_device_parameters` — set multiple device parameters in a single call (JSON array of `{name, value}` pairs). Replaces 20+ individual `set_device_parameter` calls with one round-trip. Essential for sound design tasks like creating pads, leads, etc.

### New: Dynamic Device URI Map
- **Automatic device name resolution**: say `"load Reverb on track 3"` and the server resolves the name to the correct browser URI (`query:AudioFx#Reverb`) instantly — no `search_browser` needed
- `_device_uri_map` built dynamically from browser cache after each scan (5,118 device names mapped)
- Collision resolution: Instruments > Audio Effects > MIDI Effects > Max for Live > Plug-ins > Drums > User Library
- `_resolve_device_uri()` does O(1) lookup, waits for warmup thread if map is empty

### New: Disk Browser Cache
- Browser cache is now **persisted to disk** at `~/.ableton-mcp/browser_cache.json` after each successful scan
- On startup, disk cache is loaded **instantly** (~50ms) before Ableton even connects — `search_browser` and device loading work immediately
- Background refresh still runs to keep cache fresh and re-saves to disk
- 24-hour staleness limit — disk cache is ignored if older than 1 day
- Atomic writes via temp file + `os.replace()` to prevent corruption
- `refresh_browser_cache` updates both memory and disk

### New: Singleton Guard
- **Prevents duplicate MCP server instances** — uses exclusive TCP port lock on 9881 with `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`
- Second instance exits immediately with clear error message instead of silently fighting the first

### Browser Cache Improvements
- **Expanded categories**: now scans 7 browser categories (was 5): Instruments, Drums, Audio Effects, MIDI Effects, Max for Live, Plug-ins, User Library
- **Removed non-device categories**: Sounds, Clips, Samples, Packs no longer scanned (not useful for device loading, were slowing scan)
- **Per-category item cap**: 1,500 items per category (was 5,000 shared across all — Instruments used to consume entire budget)
- **BFS depth reduced**: depth 3 (was 4) — gets device categories without individual preset files
- **Rate limiting**: 50ms delay between BFS commands to prevent socket flooding
- **60-second timeout** for browser scan commands (was 10s — Samples root was timing out)
- **Reconnect resilience**: if connection drops mid-scan, waits 2s, reconnects, and continues instead of crashing
- **Duplicate scan prevention**: `_browser_cache_populating` flag prevents warmup thread and `_resolve_device_uri` from triggering concurrent scans
- **5-second warmup delay**: gives Remote Script time to fully initialize before opening second TCP connection

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed socket concurrency crash**: browser cache scan used shared global TCP connection, corrupting it for other tools. Now uses dedicated `AbletonConnection` with proper `try/finally` cleanup
- **Fixed `_browser_cache_populating` flag not resetting** on early connection failure (was getting stuck forever, blocking all future scans)
- **Fixed hardcoded device URIs**: replaced `_WELL_KNOWN_DEVICES` dict (which had wrong URIs like `query:Audio%20Effects#Reverb`) with dynamic map from actual Ableton browser cache
- **Fixed M4L socket binding**: replaced `SO_REUSEADDR` with `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` to prevent port sharing between instances

### Performance
- Browser cache scan: ~2 minutes (was ~3.5 min with old categories, was ~100s with duplicate scans)
- **With disk cache: instant startup** — 0ms wait for search/device loading (was 2-3.5 minutes on first use)
- Total: 6,473 items cached, 5,118 device names mapped

### New: ASCII Grid Notation (2 tools)
- `clip_to_grid` — read a MIDI clip as ASCII grid notation (auto-detects drum vs melodic)
- `grid_to_clip` — write ASCII grid notation to a MIDI clip (creates clip if needed)

### New: Transport & Recording Controls (10 tools)

- `get_recording_status` — get armed tracks, record mode, and overdub state
- `set_loop_start` — set loop start position in beats
- `set_loop_end` — set loop end position in beats
- `set_loop_length` — set loop length in beats (adjusts end relative to start)
- `set_playback_position` — move the playhead to a specific beat position
- `set_arrangement_overdub` — enable or disable arrangement overdub mode
- `start_arrangement_recording` — start arrangement recording
- `stop_arrangement_recording` — stop arrangement recording

- `analyze_audio_clip` — comprehensive audio clip analysis (tempo, warp, sample properties, frequency hints)
- `set_warp_mode` — set warp mode (beats, tones, texture, re_pitch, complex, complex_pro)
- `set_clip_warp` — enable or disable warping for an audio clip
- `reverse_clip` — reverse an audio clip
- `freeze_track` / `unfreeze_track` — freeze/unfreeze tracks to reduce CPU load

- `delete_time` — delete a section of time from the arrangement (shifts everything after)
- `duplicate_time` — duplicate a section of time in the arrangement
- `insert_silence` — insert silence at a position (shifts everything after)

### New: Arrangement Automation (2 tools)

- `get_macro_values` — get current macro knob values for an Instrument Rack

### New: Cached Browser Tree (1 tool)
- `refresh_browser_cache` — force a full re-scan of Ableton's browser tree
- `search_browser` now uses an in-memory cache instead of querying Ableton directly — **instant results, no more timeouts**
- `get_browser_tree` returns cached data with URIs, so Claude can load instruments in fewer steps
- **Background warmup**: on startup, the server scans all 5 browser categories (Instruments, Sounds, Drums, Audio Effects, MIDI Effects) using a BFS walker up to **depth 4** — finds instruments AND their individual presets (e.g. `sounds/Operator/Bass/FM Bass`)
- Cache holds up to **5000 items**, auto-refreshes every **5 minutes**
- Fixes: `search_browser` no longer times out; Claude gets correct URIs instead of guessing wrong ones

### Performance & Code Streamlining
- **BFS queue fix**: Browser cache population now uses `deque.popleft()` (O(1)) instead of `list.pop(0)` (O(n))
- **Eliminated duplicate cache**: Removed unused per-category dict; added `_browser_cache_by_category` index for O(1) filtered search
- **Module-level `_CATEGORY_DISPLAY` constant**: No longer rebuilt on every `search_browser`/`get_browser_tree` call
- **Redundant double-lock removed**: `_get_browser_cache()` no longer acquires the lock twice on cache miss
- **Smarter cache warmup**: Polls for Ableton connection every 0.5s instead of blind 3s sleep — starts scanning as soon as ready
- **UDP drain bounded**: Socket drain loops capped at 100 iterations (was unbounded `while True`)
- **Hot-path logging → DEBUG**: Per-command INFO logs (send, receive, status) downgraded to DEBUG — eliminates 3 I/O calls per tool invocation
- **Lazy `%s` formatting**: ~25 logger calls switched from f-strings to `%s` style — skips string construction when log level is filtered
- **Cheaper dashboard log handler**: Stores lightweight tuples, defers timestamp formatting to when dashboard is actually viewed
- **Dashboard status build**: `top_tools` computed inside the lock — no more full dict copy on every 3s refresh
- **Fixed stale values**: Dashboard `tool_count` and comment updated from 81 → 131
- **Clean import**: `import collections` → `from collections import deque`

### Improvements
- Package renamed to `ableton-mcp-stable` for stable release channel
- Fixed server version detection (`importlib.metadata` now uses correct package name)
- Total tools: 94 -> **131** (+37 new tools, see v1.9.1 for +1 more)

## v1.8.2

### Bug Fix: `batch_set_hidden_parameters` crash
- **Fixed**: `batch_set_hidden_parameters` was crashing Ableton when setting more than 2 parameters. The root cause was Max's OSC/UDP handling corrupting long base64-encoded payloads.
- **Server fix** (`server.py`): Replaced the single base64-encoded batch OSC message with sequential individual `set_hidden_param` UDP calls via a new `_m4l_batch_set_params()` helper. Includes 50ms inter-param delay for large batches to prevent overloading Ableton.
- **M4L fix** (`m4l_bridge.js`): Added chunked processing (6 params/chunk, 50ms delay) using Max's `Task` scheduler, URL-safe base64 decode support, and debug logging.
- **Safety**: Both server and M4L bridge now filter out parameter index 0 ("Device On") to prevent accidentally disabling devices during batch operations.
- **Dynamic timeout**: M4L `send_command` timeout now scales with parameter count (~150ms per param, minimum 10s) instead of a fixed 5s.
- Updated all internal callers: `restore_device_snapshot`, `restore_group_snapshot`, `morph_between_snapshots`, `set_macro_value`.
- Total tools: **94** (unchanged)
